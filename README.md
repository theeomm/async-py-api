In this project, I am trying to learn and **understand** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) using the best practices in order to build production ready APIs.

In addition, this project also serves as my introduction to [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev), [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) and [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/)

## Tools

- API with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com)
- Database migrations with [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/)
- Code formatting with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)
- Import sorting with [isort](https://isort.readthedocs.io/)
- Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)

## Expected outcomes

- Be able to confidently build a functional REST and/or GraphQL API with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) and [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/)
- Build a TDD FastAPI project with pytest
- Build a scalabale API with FastAPI

## Resources

I have the utilized the following resources to learn everything done thi project.

- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) documentation with major focus on the `FastAPI and Pydantic` section.
